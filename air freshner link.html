<h1> About It</h1>
<h2> An air freshener is a product designed to mask or remove unpleasant room odors. These products typically deliver fragrance and other odor counteractants into the air. They do so through a variety of product formats, including aerosols, candles, potpourri, and gels. By the late 1990s, sales of air fresheners in the United States had exceeded several hundred million dollars per year. One the most successful new products are Glade Plug-Ins, which use heat generated by electric current to vaporize air-freshening ingredients.</h2>
