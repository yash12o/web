<h2 id="h"  style="text-align:center;">History Of This Soap</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <i>Soap is an anionic surfactant used in conjunction with water for washing and cleaning that historically comes in solid bars but also in the form of a thick liquid . Soap , consisting of sodium (soda ash) or potassium (potash) salts of fatty acids is obtained by reacting fat with lye in a process known as saponification . Soap is integral to our society today , and we find it hard to imagine a time when people were kept sweet-smelling by the action of perfume rather than soap . However , the current widespread use of soap is only a very recent occurrence , despite the fact that it has been made for more than 2500 years . The first recorded manufacture of soap was in 600BC , when Pliny the Elder described its manufacture by the Phonecians from goats tallow and ash , and it was known among the British Celts and throughout the Roman Empire . However , these people used their soap medicinally, and it was not until the second century AD that it was used for cleaning , and not until the nineteenth century that it began to be commonly used in the Western world .This soap is which is made by flower juice in factory near NH54 , Hisar , Haryana , India . </i></p>
